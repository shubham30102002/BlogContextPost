# Blog Website

This is a personal project that I created to showcase my skills and interests in web development. It is a responsive and user-friendly blog website built with React, Context API, and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- The website displays blogs on various topics, such as AI, web development, and software engineering. Each blog has a title, an image, a summary, and a link to read more.
- The website uses browser routes to navigate between different pages, such as home, about, and contact.
- The website has a sidebar that shows the categories of the blogs, such as AI, web development, and software engineering. Clicking on a category will filter the blogs by that topic.
- The website also has clickable tags at the bottom of each blog, such as React, Tailwind, and Context. Clicking on a tag will show all the blogs that have that tag.
- The website has a dark/light mode toggle button at the top right corner, which allows the user to switch between dark and light themes.
